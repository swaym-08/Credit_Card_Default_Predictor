# Credit_Card_Default_Predictor

This project is aimed at predicting the case of customers default payments. From the perspective of risk management, the result of predictive accuracy of the estimated probability of default will be more valuable than the binary result of classification - credible or not credible clients.
I have used 3 different algorithms : SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE, DECISION TREE AND RANDOM FOREST CLASSIFIER.

Further work can be done in order to improve the performance metrics of the models.
